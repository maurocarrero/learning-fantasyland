# Learning Fantasy Land Specification.

These are examples to learn functional programming using Fantasy Land specification.
Other goodies are included and are not necessarily related to below resources.

Start here: [FantasyLand](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land)
I am mostly using the guide in [Tom Harding's blog](http://www.tomharding.me), I recommend to follow it.

Examples were taken from different resources:
1. [Tom Harding's blog](http://www.tomharding.me)
3. [Learn Functional Programming with JavaScript](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-path-javascript/9781788471282/)
